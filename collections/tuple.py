# tuple = () ordered and unchangeable DUPLICATES ARE OK. Faster than lists

fruits = ("apple", "orange", "banana", "pear", "grape", "peach")
# print(dir(fruits))
# print(help(fruits))
# print(len(fruits)) #get len of tuple
# print("lemon" in fruits) #does some exist 

# print(fruits.count("orange")) #count
# print(fruits.index("grape"))

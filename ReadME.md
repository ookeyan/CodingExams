Python Libraries Needed for Coding Exams:
collections: This module provides specialized container datatypes like Counter, deque, OrderedDict, and defaultdict, which can be very useful for certain types of problems.

heapq: Useful for implementing heaps (priority queues). Many problems on LeetCode involve finding the k-th largest/smallest elements, and heapq can be very handy for these.
itertools: This module provides a set of fast, memory-efficient tools for working with iterators. Functions like permutations, combinations, and product can simplify complex iteration problems.
functools: Contains higher-order functions that act on or return other functions. lru_cache from functools can be particularly useful for optimizing recursive solutions.
bisect: This module helps with maintaining a list in sorted order without having to sort the list after each insertion. Itâ€™s useful for binary search problems.
math: Provides access to mathematical functions like gcd, factorial, and sqrt, which can be useful for a variety of problems.
random: Useful for problems that require random number generation or shuffling.
